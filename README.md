# Windows-AI-Assistant
Developed a Windows-based Voice Assistant that performs system automation and user commands using Speech-to-Text (STT) + Natural Language Processing (NLP).  Created a custom dataset of voice commands/intents (like open apps, search web, system control, greetings, etc.) and mapped each intent to specific actions.
